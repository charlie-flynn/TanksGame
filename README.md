# TanksGame
 
This is a game about digging for rare gems as an underground tank unit. The game can be accessed by extracting the .zip file in (https://github.com/charlie-flynn/TanksGame/releases) to your preferred folder, and opening the .exe file. The goal of the game is to find three bright blue gems buried in the ground tiles around your tank unit. You can move around with the W, A, S, and D keys, point with your mouse to aim the tank's digging cannon, and press the left mouse button to fire ionized excavation rounds. Once all three gems have been gathered, you will win! Don't forget to check out our Twitter by clicking the in-game link!
